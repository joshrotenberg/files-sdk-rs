Querying webhook logs is a little different than other APIs.\n\nAll queries against the archive must be submitted as Exports.  (Even our Web UI creates an Export behind the scenes.)\n\nIn any query field in this API, you may specify multiple values separated by commas.  That means that commas\ncannot be searched for themselves, and neither can single quotation marks.\n\nUse the following steps to complete an export:\n\n1. Initiate the export by using the Create Action Notification Export endpoint. Non Site Admins must query by folder or path.\n2. Using the `id` from the response to step 1, poll the Show Action Notification Export endpoint. Check the `status` field until it is `ready`.\n3. You can download the results of the export as a CSV file using the `results_url` field in the response from step 2. If you want to page through the records in JSON format, use the List Action Notification Export Results endpoint, passing the `id` that you got in step 1 as the `action_notification_export_id` parameter. Check the `X-Files-Cursor-Next` header to see if there are more records available, and resubmit the same request with a `cursor` parameter to fetch the next page of results.  Unlike most API Endpoints, this endpoint does not provide `X-Files-Cursor-Prev` cursors allowing reverse pagination through the results.  This is due to limitations in Amazon Athena, the underlying data lake for these records.\n\nIf you intend to use this API for high volume or automated use, please contact us with more information\nabout your use case.\n\n## Example Queries\n\n* History for a folder: `{ \"query_folder\": \"path/to/folder\" }`\n* History for a range of time: `{ \"start_at\": \"2021-03-18 12:00:00\", \"end_at\": \"2021-03-19 12:00:00\" }`\n* History of all notifications that used GET or POST: `{ \"query_request_method\": \"GET,POST\" }`\n","description":"ActionNotificationExportEntity model"},"ActionNotificationExportResultEntity":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"integer","format":"int32","example":1,"description":"Notification ID"},"created_at":{"type":"integer","format":"int32","example":1,"description":"When the notification was sent."},"status":{"type":"integer","format":"int32","example":200,"description":"HTTP status code returned in the webhook response."},"message":{"type":"string","example":"Success","description":"A message indicating the overall status of the webhook notification."},"success":{"type":"boolean","example":true,"description":"`true` if the webhook succeeded by receiving a 200 or 204 response."},"request_headers":{"type":"string","example":"{\"User-Agent\":\"Files.com Webhook\"}","description":"A JSON-encoded string with headers that were sent with the webhook."},"request_method":{"type":"string","example":"GET","description":"The HTTP verb used to perform the webhook."},"request_url":{"type":"string","example":"www.example.com/webhook_receiver","description":"The webhook request URL."},"path":{"type":"string","example":"MyFolder/MyFile.txt","description":"The path to the actual file that triggered this notification."},"folder":{"type":"string","example":"MyFolder","description":"The folder associated with the triggering action for this notification."}},"x-docs":"An ActionNotificationExportResult is a single record containing webhook log information that can be obtained as a part of Action Notification Export request.\n","description":"ActionNotificationExportResultEntity model"},"ApiKeyEntity":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"integer","format":"int32","example":1,"description":"API Key ID"},"descriptive_label":{"type":"string","example":"Site-wide API key for https://site.files.com/ (key ID #1)","description":"Unique label that describes this API key.

Files.com offers a variety of authentication methods to ensure flexibility, security, migration, and compliance.\n\nThese authentication methods can be configured during user creation and can be modified at any time by site administrators. The meanings of the available values are as follows:\n\n* `password` - Allows authentication via a password.  If API Keys or SSH (SFTP) Keys are also configured, those can be used *instead* of the password.  If Two Factor Authentication (2FA) methods are also configured, a valid 2nd factor is required in addition to the password.\n* `email_signup` - When set upon user creation, an email will be sent to the new user with a link for them to create their password. Once the user has created their password, their authentication type will change to `password`.\n* `sso` - Allows authentication via a linked Single Sign On provider.  If API Keys or SSH (SFTP) Keys are also configured, those can be used *instead* of Single Sign On.  If Two Factor Authentication (2FA) methods are also configured, a valid 2nd factor is required in addition to Single Sign On.  When using this method, you must also provide a valid `sso_strategy_id` to associate the User to the appropriate SSO provider.\n* `password_with_imported_hash` - Works like the `password` method but allows importing a hashed password in MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 format.  Provide the imported hash in the field `imported_password_hash`.  Upon first use, the password will be converted to Files.com's internal storage format and the authentication type will change to `password`. Typically only used when migrating to Files.com from another MFT solution.\n* `none` - Does not allow authentication via username and password, but does allow authentication via API Key or SSH (SFTP) Key.  Typically only used for service users.\n* `password_and_ssh_key` - Allows authentication only by providing a password and also a valid SSH (SFTP) Key in a single attempt.  If API Keys are also configured, those can be used *instead* of the password and key combination.  This method only works with (typically enterprise) SSH/SFTP clients capable of sending both authentication methods at once.  Typically only used for service users.\n","description":"UserEntity model"},"IpAddressEntity":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","example":"Site","description":"Unique label for list; used by Zapier and other integrations."},"associated_with":{"type":"string","example":"Site","description":"The object that this public IP address list is associated with."},"group_id":{"type":"integer","format":"int32","example":1,"description":"Group ID"},"ip_addresses":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"example":["127.0.0.1"],"description":"A list of IP addresses."}},"x-docs":"An IPAddress is a record of IP addresses that you can use to automate keeping your firewall's configuration up to date.\n\nCustomers who maintain custom firewall configurations may require knowing the public IP addresses of Files.com's edge servers.\n","description":"IpAddressEntity model"},"DnsRecordEntity":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","example":"customdomain.com-CNAME-site.files.com","description":"Unique label for DNS record; used by Zapier and other integrations."},"domain":{"type":"string","example":"my-custom-domain.com","description":"DNS record domain name"},"rrtype":{"type":"string","example":"CNAME","description":"DNS record type"},"value":{"type":"string","example":"mysite.files.com","description":"DNS record value"}},"x-docs":"A DNSRecord is a custom DNS configuration record for a Site.\n\nThey represent the records you will need to configure in your DNS hosting provider to allow custom domains to work with Files.com.\n","description":"DnsRecordEntity model"},"StatusEntity":{"type":"object","properties":{"code":{"type":"integer","format":"int32","example":200,"description":"Status HTTP code"},"message":{"type":"string","example":"example","description":"Error message"},"status":{"type":"string","example":"","description":"Status message"},"data":{"$ref":"#/definitions/AutoEntity","example":"example","description":"Additional data"},"errors":{"type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/definitions/ErrorsEntity"},"example":[{"fields":[],"messages":[]}],"description":"A list of api errors"},"clickwrap_id":{"type":"integer","format":"int32","example":1,"description":"Required Clickwrap id"},"clickwrap_body":{"type":"string","example":"example","description":"Required Clickwrap body"}},"x-docs":null,"description":"StatusEntity model"},"AutoEntity":{"type":"object","properties":{"dynamic":{"type":"object","properties":{}}},"x-docs":null},"ErrorsEntity":{"type":"object","properties":{"fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"example":[],"description":"A list of fields where errors occur"},"messages":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"example":[],"description":"A list of error messages"}},"x-docs":null},"PublicKeyEntity":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"integer","format":"int32","example":1,"description":"Public key ID"},"title":{"type":"string","example":"My public key","description":"Public key title"},"created_at":{"type":"string","format":"date-time","example":"2000-01-01T01:00:00Z","description":"Public key created at date/time"},"fingerprint":{"type":"string","example":"43:51:43:a1:b5:fc:8b:b7:0a:3a:a9:b1:0f:66:73:a8","description":"Public key fingerprint (MD5)"},"fingerprint_sha256":{"type":"string","example":"V5Q5t/ghT3R8Tol5GX9385bzmpygWVRnLuI9EXNrjCX","description":"Public key fingerprint (SHA256)"},"status":{"type":"string","enum":["error","not_set","to_be_generated","generating","complete"],"example":"complete","description":"Only returned when generating keys.

When generating keys, the system uses these default lengths unless a specific length is specified.\n\nFiles.com also supports importing additional key types that cannot be generated: security key types (sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, sk-ssh-ed25519).

For example, `path/to/*` matches `path/to/folder1` and `path/to/folder2`, but not `path/to/folder1/subfolder`.\n\n`**` matches subfolders recursively.  For example, `path/to/**` matches `path/to/folder1`, `path/to/folder1/subfolder`, `path/to/folder2`, `path/to/folder2/subfolder`, etc.\n\n`?` matches any one character.\n\nUse square brackets `[]` to match any character from a set. This works like a regular expression, including negation using `^`.\n\nCurly brackets `{}` can be used to denote parts of a pattern which will accept a number of alternatives, separated by commas `,`.\nThese alternatives can either be literal text or include special characters including nested curly brackets.\nFor example `{Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri}` would match abbreviated weekdays, and `202{3-{0[7-9],1?},4-0[1-6]}-*` would match dates from `2023-07-01` through `2024-06-30`.\n\nTo match any of the special characters literally, precede it with a backslash and enclose that pair with square brackets. For example to match a literal `?`, use `[\\?]`.\n\nGlobs are supported on `path`, `source`, and `exclude_pattern` fields. Globs are not supported on remote paths of any kind or for any field.\n\nBy default, Copy and Move automations that use globs will implicitly replicate matched folder structures at the destination.  If you want to flatten the folder structure, set `flatten_destination_structure` to `true`.\n\n## Automation Triggers\n\nAutomations can be triggered in the following ways:\n\n* `custom_schedule` : The automation will run according to the custom schedule parameters for `days_of_week` (0-based) and `times_of_day`. A time zone may be specified via `time_zone` in Rails TimeZone name format.\n* `daily` : The automation will run once in a picked `interval`. You can specify `recurring_day` to select day number inside a picked `interval` it should be run on.\n* `webhook` : the automation will run when a request is sent to the corresponding webhook URL.\n* `action` : The automation will run when a specific action happens, e.g. a file is created or downloaded.\n\nFuture enhancements will allow Automations to be triggered by an incoming email, or by other services.\n\nCurrently, all Automation types support all triggers, with the following exceptions: `Create Folder` and  `Run Remote Server Sync` are not supported by the `action` trigger.\n\nAutomations can be triggered manually if trigger is not set to `action`.\n\n## Destinations\n\nThe `destinations` parameter is a list of paths where files will be copied, moved, or created. It may include formatting parameters to dynamically determine the destination at runtime.\n\n### Relative vs. Absolute Paths\n\nIn order to specify a relative path, it must start with either `./` or `../`. All other paths are considered absolute. In general, leading slashes should never be used on Files.com paths, including here. Paths are interpreted as absolute in all contexts, even without a leading slash.\n\n### Files vs. Folders\n\nIf the destination path ends with a `/`, the filename from the source path will be preserved and put into the folder of this name.  If the destination path does not end with a `/`, it will be interpreted as a filename and will override the source file's filename entirely.\n\n### Formatting Parameters\n\n**Action-Triggered Automations**\n\n* `%tf` : The name of the file that triggered the automation.\n* `%tp` : The path of the file that triggered the automation.\n* `%td` : The directory of the file that triggered the automation.\n* `%tb` : The name of the file (without extension) that triggered the automation.\n* `%te` : The extension of the file that triggered the automation.\n\nFor example, if the triggering file is at `path/to/file.txt`, then the automation destination `path/to/dest/incoming-%tf` will result in the actual destination being `path/to/dest/incoming-file.txt`.\n\n**Parent Folders**\n\nTo reference the parent folder of a source file, use `%p1`, `%p2`, `%p3`, etc. for the first, second, third, etc. parent folder, respectively.\n\nFor example, if the source file is at `accounts/file.txt`, then the automation destination `path/to/dest/%p1/some_file_name.txt` will result in the actual destination being `path/to/dest/accounts/some_file_name.txt`.\n\n**Dates and Times**\n\n* `%Y`  : The current year (4 digits)\n* `%m`  : The current month (2 digits)\n* `%B`  : The current month (full name)\n* `%d`  : The current day (2 digits)\n* `%H`  : The current hour (2 digits, 24-hour clock)\n* `%M`  : The current minute (2 digits)\n* `%S`  : The current second (2 digits)\n* `%z`  : UTC Time Zone (e.g. -0900)\n\nFor example, if the current date is June 23, 2023 and the source file is named `daily_sales.csv`, then the following automation destination `path/to/dest/%Y/%m/%d/` will result in the actual destination being `path/to/dest/2023/06/23/daily_sales.csv`.\n\n### Replacing Text\n\nTo replace text in the source filename, use the `destination_replace_from` and `destination_replace_to` parameters. This will perform a simple text replacement on the source filename before inserting it into the destination path.\n\nFor example, if the `destination_replace_from` is `incoming` and the `destination_replace_to` is `outgoing`, then `path/to/incoming.txt` will translate to `path/to/outgoing.txt`.\n\n\n## Automation Types\n\nThere are several types of automations:  Create Folder, Copy File, Move File, Delete File and, Run Remote Server Sync.\n\n\n### Create Folder\n\nCreates the folder with named by `destinations` in the path named by `path`.\nDestination may include formatting parameters to insert the date/time into the destination name.\n\nExample Use case:  Our business files sales tax for each division in 11 states every quarter.\nI want to create the folders where those sales tax forms and data will be collected.\n\nI could create a Create Folder automation as follows:\n\n* Trigger: `daily`\n* Interval: `quarter_end`\n* Path: `AccountingAndTax/SalesTax/State/*/`\n* Destinations: `%Y/Quarter-ending-%m-%d`\n\nNote this assumes you have folders in `AccountingAndTax/SalesTax/State/` already created for each state, e.g. `AccountingAndTax/SalesTax/State/CA/`.\n\n\n### Delete File\n\nDeletes the file with path matching `source` (wildcards allowed) in the path named by `path`.\n\n\n### Copy File\n\nCopies files in the folder named by `path` to the path specified in `destinations`.\nThe automation will only fire on files matching the `source` (wildcards allowed). In the case of an action-triggered automation, it will only operate on the actual file that triggered the automation.\nIf the parameter `limit` exists, the automation will only copy the newest `limit` files in each matching folder.\n\n\n### Move File\n\nMoves files in the folder named by `path` to the path specified in `destinations`.\nThe automation will only fire on files matching the `source` (wildcards allowed). In the case of an action-triggered automation, it will only operate on the actual file that triggered the automation.\nIf the parameter `limit` exists, the automation will only move the newest `limit` files in each matching folder.\nNote that for a move with multiple destinations, all but one destination is treated as a copy.\n\n\n### Run Remote Server Sync\n\nThe Run Remote Server Sync automation runs the remote server syncs specified by the `sync_ids`.\n\nTypically when this automation is used, the remote server syncs in question are set to the manual\nscheduling mode (`manual` to `true` via the API) to disable the built in sync scheduler.\n\n\n### Import File\n\nRetrieves files from one or more URLs and saves the results under the path specified in `destinations`.\n\nThe URLs to retrieve are specified as a JSON array in the `import_urls` property.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"response.json\",\n    \"url\": \"https://example.com/api\",\n    \"method\": \"post\",\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n    },\n    \"content\": { \"trigger-file\": \"%tp\" }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe recognized keys are:\n\n* `name`: The file name which will be used to save the returned content. Required. `%` tokens will be replaced as described under Formatting Parameters.\n* `url`: The URL which will be requested. Required.\n* `method`: The HTTP method to be used for the request. May be either `get` or `post` (case insensitive).

Let us know!\nWe are actively improving the types of automations offered on our platform.\n\n\n## Retrying Failures\n\nAutomations will automatically retry individual action steps up to 3 times, with pauses between retries that increase from 15 seconds to 1 minute.  If individual action steps fail after our 3rd attempt, that action will fail.  If every action step in an Automation Run fails, that automation run will move to a `failure` status.  If at least one step succeeds and one step fails, that automation run will move to a `partial_failure` status.\n\nAutomation Runs can be retried automatically when they enter a `failure` or `partial_failure` status as described above.  A retry will re-run the automation from scratch, including the \"planning\" phase, which expands globs (wildcards) and identifies which files to transfer or skip.\n\nRetrying of entire Automation Runs must be explicitly enabled by setting the `retry_on_failure_interval_in_minutes` and `retry_on_failure_number_of_attempts` values on the Automation.\n","description":"AutomationEntity model"},"AutomationLogEntity":{"type":"object","properties":{"timestamp":{"type":"string","format":"date-time","example":"2000-01-01T01:00:00Z","description":"Start Time of Action.

We've done our best to expose search capabilities via this History Export API.\n\nIn any query field in this API, you may specify multiple values separated by commas.  That means that commas\ncannot be searched for themselves, and neither can single quotation marks.\n\nWe do not currently partition data by date on the backend, so all queries result in a full scan of the entire\ndata lake.  This means that all queries will take about the same amount of time to complete, and we incur about\nthe same cost per query internally.  We don't typically bill our customers for these queries, assuming\nusage is occasional and manual.\n\nIf you intend to use this API for high volume or automated use, please contact us with more information\nabout your use case.
