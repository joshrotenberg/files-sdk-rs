# Showcase CLI Example Ideas for files-sdk-rs

Since Files.com already has a general-purpose CLI, here are some focused, specialized CLI tools that showcase the Rust SDK's strengths while providing real utility:

## 1. **files-watch** - Filesystem Sync Daemon (Most Complex & Impressive)

A robust daemon that watches local directories and syncs changes to Files.com in real-time.

**Features**:
- Uses `notify` crate for efficient filesystem watching
- Bidirectional sync (local → remote and remote → local)
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Streaming uploads with progress bars
- Incremental sync (only changed files)
- `.filesignore` support (like `.gitignore`)
- Multi-threaded uploads with tokio
- Persistent state/resume capability
- Webhook listener for remote changes

**Why it's cool**:
- Demonstrates async/await patterns
- Shows streaming API in real-world use
- Progress tracking on multiple concurrent uploads
- Complex state management
- Integration with automation/webhooks APIs
- Very practical tool people would actually use

**Commands**:
```bash
files-watch init /local/dir --remote /backup
files-watch start --daemon
files-watch status
files-watch pause
files-watch sync --direction up  # one-time sync
```

## 2. **files-backup** - Smart Backup Tool

A specialized backup tool with deduplication and compression.

**Features**:
- Incremental backups with change detection
- Compression before upload (gzip/zstd)
- Encryption support
- Backup rotation/retention policies
- Restore with point-in-time recovery
- Parallel uploads of multiple files
- Metadata preservation
- Backup verification

**Why it's cool**:
- Showcases streaming API for large backups
- Demonstrates file operations at scale
- Progress bars for multiple concurrent operations
- Real-world use case (backup Redis data, logs, etc.)
- Could integrate with redisctl!

**Commands**:
```bash
files-backup create /data --dest /backups/2025-01-07
files-backup list --remote /backups
files-backup restore /backups/2025-01-07 --to /restore
files-backup verify /backups/2025-01-07
files-backup prune --keep-last 7
```

## 3. **files-share** - Advanced Sharing CLI

A CLI focused on the sharing/collaboration features of Files.com.

**Features**:
- Create share bundles with expiration
- Generate time-limited download links
- Create upload-only request folders
- Set download limits and passwords
- Track download analytics
- QR code generation for share links
- Bulk sharing operations
- Email notifications integration

**Why it's cool**:
- Showcases sharing APIs (bundles, requests)
- Demonstrates user/permission management
- QR codes are fun and visual
- Practical for sending files to non-technical users
- Analytics/reporting features

**Commands**:
```bash
files-share create /report.pdf --expires 7d --password secret
files-share qr https://app.files.com/...  # generates QR code
files-share request /uploads/submissions --notify me@example.com
files-share stats bundle_id_123
files-share revoke bundle_id_123
```

## 4. **files-audit** - Audit & Compliance Tool

A CLI for compliance, auditing, and security monitoring.

**Features**:
- Export audit logs to JSON/CSV
- Search logs with filters
- Real-time log streaming
- Anomaly detection (unusual download patterns)
- User activity reports
- Permission audits
- Compliance reports (who accessed what)
- Integration with SIEM systems

**Why it's cool**:
- Showcases logs APIs comprehensively
- Demonstrates pagination for large datasets
- Real-time streaming with websockets/webhooks
- Security-focused (good for enterprise users)
- Data export/reporting features

**Commands**:
```bash
files-audit logs --user john@example.com --since 30d
files-audit export --format csv --output audit.csv
files-audit watch --filter download  # real-time streaming
files-audit permissions --user-id 123
files-audit report --type compliance --output report.pdf
```

## 5. **files-bench** - Performance Testing Tool

A benchmarking tool for Files.com operations.

**Features**:
- Upload/download performance testing
- Concurrent operation testing
- Latency measurements
- Throughput analysis
- Comparison mode (test multiple configs)
- Generate performance reports with charts
- Stress testing (max concurrent uploads)

**Why it's cool**:
- Demonstrates streaming API performance
- Showcases progress tracking for many operations
- Generates visual reports (using plotters crate)
- Useful for capacity planning
- Good for SDK performance validation

**Commands**:
```bash
files-bench upload /data --size 100MB --concurrency 10
files-bench download /remote --connections 5
files-bench stress --duration 60s --operations 1000
files-bench compare --baseline results.json
files-bench report results.json --output report.html
```

## 6. **files-migrate** - Migration Tool

Migrate data between cloud storage providers to Files.com.

**Features**:
- Migrate from S3/GCS/Azure to Files.com
- Preserve metadata and permissions
- Parallel transfers with retry logic
- Bandwidth throttling
- Dry-run mode
- Progress tracking with ETA
- Resume interrupted migrations
- Pre-migration validation

**Why it's cool**:
- Multi-cloud integration (boto3/cloud SDKs)
- Complex streaming scenarios
- Demonstrates reliability patterns (retry, resume)
- Very practical for enterprises
- Shows SDK scalability

**Commands**:
```bash
files-migrate from-s3 s3://bucket/path --to /files
files-migrate validate s3://bucket/path
files-migrate resume migration_id_123
files-migrate status migration_id_123
```

- Demonstrates the most SDK features
- Real-world utility
- Good portfolio piece

**For Practical Value**: **#2 files-backup** (backup tool)
- Solves a real problem
- Could integrate with redisctl (your original use case!)
- Shows streaming API strengths
- Easy to understand value proposition

**For Quick Win**: **#3 files-share** (sharing CLI)
- Smaller scope
- Unique features (QR codes, analytics)
- Good for demos
- Less complex than sync daemon

**For Enterprise Appeal**: **#4 files-audit** (audit tool)
- Security/compliance focus
- Comprehensive API coverage
- Good for marketing to enterprises

## Implementation Approach:

Whatever we choose, I'd recommend:

1. **Use `clap`** for CLI parsing (derive API)
2. **Use `indicatif`** for progress bars
3. **Use `tokio`** for async runtime
4. **Use `tracing`** for logging
5. **Use `serde`** for config/state files
6. **Use `anyhow`** for error handling (app-level)
7. **Use `colored`** for terminal colors

Structure:
```

│   │   └── ...
│   ├── config.rs

```

Let me know which direction sounds most interesting and I can start building it out!
